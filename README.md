Glyph Catch is a fan-made Pokémon collecting game for the Nothing Phone 3 that rewards you for leaving your phone down. The included Glyph Toy displays a digital clock by default, but after some screen-off time, Pokémon will appear on your Glyph Matrix. The longer your phone has been locked, the higher your chance of rare encounters. Press the touch button to catch the Pokémon and build your Pokédex!

**Pokémon appear based on real-world conditions.** Weather conditions boost certain Pokémon types. Zubat comes out at night. Phone running low on battery? Voltorb and its evolution might show up. And with Halloween approaching, you can of course expect Ghost Pokémon. Keep an eye on the daily Trainer Tips in the app for hints! **All 151 Kanto Pokémon are obtainable.**

**There's more to do than just catching.** Choose a Pokémon to level up, and it gains EXP while your phone is face-down. Pokémon will evolve when they hit the right level. You'll find items like evolution stones, Rare Candies for leveling, and the Super Rod to fish for certain aquatic species.

## Q&A

### Can I fail catches?

No: when you throw a Poké Ball, you have a 100% chance of catching the Pokémon. Glyph Catch is designed to be consistently rewarding and stress-free. Up to four Pokémon can accumulate, and they stay indefinitely. The only chance element is finding Pokémon.

### What if the phone is in my pocket instead of face-down?

Technically, as long as your phone stays locked and the Glyph Matrix is on, it's counted as "screen-off time". So you won't lose your streak if you quickly check your lock screen for a potentially urgent message.

### Won't I just accumulate a ton of Pokémon overnight?

Not usually: very few Pokémon appear during bedtime! You can adjust your sleep schedule in the settings menu. Fun fact: if you get at least 7.5 hours of screen-off time, you gain a bonus chance of rare encounters the next day.

### Does this impact my battery life?

Not that I've noticed. And if you actually end up using your phone for just a few minutes less per day, that's almost certainly a net gain for battery life.
