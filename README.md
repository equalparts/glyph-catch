### A Pokémon fan-game for the Nothing Phone 3

Glyph Catch is a fan-made Pokémon catching game for the Nothing Phone 3 with its Glyph Matrix display. It's designed to encourage healthier phone usage: leave your phone face-down and live your life. When you check back, Pokémon might be waiting on the Glyph Matrix. Long-press the touch button to catch them and complete your Pokédex. No Pokémon around? The Glyph Toy shows a useful digital clock instead!

**Pokémon spawn based on real-world conditions.** The longer your phone stays face-down, the rarer the encounters. Rain attracts Water-types. Ghosts come out at night. Your phone's running low on battery? Voltorb and Electrode might roll by. Halloween nearing? Ghost Pokémon are everywhere. Full moon tonight? Clefairy and Jigglypuff are out. Check the `Daily trainer tips` for hints about what might show up.

**There's more to do than just catching.** Choose a training partner to level up while your phone is face-down. Pokémon will evolve when they reach certain levels. You'll find items like evolution stones to evolve specific Pokémon, rare candies to speed up training, and tools like the Super Rod to fish for aquatic Pokémon. Completing milestones unlocks special encounters—fossil Pokémon, legendary birds, and even Mewtwo if you're dedicated enough.
