### A Pokémon fan-game for the Nothing Phone 3

Glyph Catch is a fan-made Pokémon catching game for the Nothing Phone 3 with its Glyph Matrix display. Leave your phone face-down for a while and Pokémon will appear on the Glyph Matrix. Long-press the touch button to catch the Pokémon and complete your Pokédex!

The included Glyph Toy must be configured as your Always-on Glyph Toy for the game to function. When there isn't a Pokémon to catch, the Glyph Toy will show as a simple digital clock.

### How it works

The longer your phone stays face-down, the rarer the Pokémon you might encounter. The type of Pokémon that appear can also be influenced by a variety of real-world conditions, like current weather, festive seasons, or even your phone's battery level. Keep an eye on the `Daily trainer tips` for hints!
