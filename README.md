Glyph Catch is a fan-made Pokémon catching game for the Nothing Phone 3 that rewards you for reducing screen time! Leave your phone down a while, and Pokémon appear on your Glyph Matrix. The longer your phone has been locked, the higher your chance of rare encounters. Press the touch button to catch the Pokémon and build your Pokédex!

**Pokémon appear based on real-world conditions.** Weather conditions boost certain Pokémon types. Zubat comes out at night. Phone running low on battery? Voltorb and its evolution might show up. And with Halloween approaching, you can of course expect Ghost Pokémon. Keep an eye on the daily Trainer Tips in the app for hints! **All 151 Kanto Pokémon are obtainable.**

**There's more to do than just catching.** Choose a Pokémon to level up, and it gains EXP while your phone is face-down. Pokémon will evolve when they hit the right level. You'll also find items, like evolution stones, Rare Candies for leveling, and the Super Rod to fish for certain aquatic species.

When there are no Pokémon around to catch, the Glyph Toy displays a handy digital clock instead.

## Q&A

### Can I fail catches?

No: when you throw a Poké Ball, you have a 100% chance of catching the Pokémon. Glyph Catch is designed to be consistently rewarding and stress-free. Up to four Pokémon can accumulate, and they stay indefinitely—even if you do unlock your phone after. The only chance element is finding Pokémon.

### What if the phone is in my pocket instead of face-down?

Technically, as long as your phone stays locked and the Glyph Matrix is on, it's counted as "screen-off time". So you won't lose your streak, even if you quickly check your lock screen for a potentially urgent message.

### Won't I just accumulate a ton of Pokémon overnight?

Not usually: very few Pokémon appear during bedtime! You can adjust your sleep schedule in the settings menu. Fun fact: if you get at least 7.5 hours of screen-off time, you gain a bonus chance of rare encounters the next day.

### Does this impact my battery life?

Not that I've noticed. And if you actually end up using your phone for just a few minutes less per day, that's almost certainly a net gain for battery life.

### Can I set a dark background for the Glyph Toy?

No - the source sprites would need manual reworking for dark backgrounds (shading, outlines), on top of already adapting them to the 25x25 monochrome display. With 151+ Pokémon, it's beyond the scope of this fan project.

However: if you prefer, you can dim the sprite and background slightly under Settings > Graphics (as of v1.2.0).

### No Pokémon are appearing for me, what's wrong?

Make sure you configured Glyph Catch as your Always-on Glyph Toy: open Android settings > Glyph Interface > Glyph Toys > ⚙️ > Always-on Glyph Toys and pick Glyph Catch. It is recommended to set the timeout to 1 minute or less.

The Glyph Toy needs to detect at least 15 consecutive minutes of screen-off time before Pokémon can appear.

Note that Essential Notifications may disconnect the Glyph Toy and disrupt the timer. If you are getting too many Essential Notifications, consider scheduling quiet time in apps that support it and/or narrowing the Essential Notification rules.

## Privacy
