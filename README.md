### A Pokémon fan-game for the Nothing Phone 3

Glyph Catch is a fan-made Pokémon catching game for the Nothing Phone 3 that rewards healthier phone usage habits. Leave your phone face-down for a while. When you check back, Pokémon might be waiting on the Glyph Matrix. The longer your phone stays face-down, the rarer the encounters. Long-press the touch button to catch them and complete your Pokédex. No Pokémon around? The Glyph Toy shows a useful digital clock instead!

**Pokémon appear based on real-world conditions.** Rain attracts Water-types. Zubat comes out at night. Phone running low on battery? Voltorb and Electrode might roll by. Halloween nearing? Ghost Pokémon are everywhere. Full moon tonight? Clefairy and Jigglypuff are out. Keep an eye on the `Daily trainer tips` for hints!

**There's more to do than just catching.** Choose a training partner to level up while your phone is face-down. Pokémon will evolve when they reach certain levels. You'll find items like evolution stones to evolve specific Pokémon, rare candies to speed up training, and tools like the Super Rod to fish for aquatic Pokémon. Completing milestones unlocks special encounters—fossil Pokémon, legendary birds, and even Mewtwo if you're dedicated enough.
